# Granny Synth
_Summer practice project for SPbSTU._

## Info

Sound is generated by playing the same noise ('grain') repeatedly at very high speed. This merges into a tone that is an audible hybrid of the repetition rate and the original grain. It sounds quite similar to an oscillator with two resonating bandpass filters, although the different architecture means there are lots of additional interesting noises at parameter extremes.

The grain consists of two triangular waves of adjustable frequency, and adjustable decay rate. This is based on FOF synthesis model, but using triangle waves instead of sine and using a rectangular window.

The repetition rate is set by another control.

_Project was parcially based on this:_

5 - Potentiometers - 4.7K (or 5K) with knobs;
1 - Arduino Nano board;
1 - 1/4" Mono Phone Jack;
1 - 2.1mm Power Adapter Jack (Fully Shielded);
1 - 9V DC Power Adapter (Rated at 50mA or more);
1 - Hammond or any other enclosure;
1 - 4 channel Dip switch;
1 - Opto-isolator (6N138);
1 - DIN 5 MIDI;
4 - Resistors (one each: 220, 470, 1k, 2.2k Ohm);
1 - Diode;
2 - Capacitors (electrolytic: 100uF, ceramic: 33nF);
...and a lot of wires.

## Usage

1. Wire up all components (be sure to check port number in code's #define section);
2. Upload sketch into Arduino;
3. Connect headphones or speaker to the synth and tweak the knobs.
